# Kammi Landing Page - Lovable Prompt

## What is Kammi?
Kammi is a minimalist desktop writing application for Mac and Windows. It's designed as a **refuge for writers** — distraction-free, warm, and personal. Think of it as the digital equivalent of writing with pen and paper in a cozy cabin.

## Brand Philosophy
- **A refuge, not a productivity tool**
- **Kind, safe, eloquent, beautiful**
- **Immersive** — fullscreen by default, no UI noise
- **Personal** — greets you by name ("Good evening, Olli")
- **Target audience**: Creative professionals — novelists, playwrights, journalers
