## What is Kammi?

A distraction-free writing app designed to be a refuge, not a productivity tool. No word counts, no metrics, no gamification — just you and your words.

## Download

**[→ Download the latest release](../../releases/latest)**

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `Kammi-x.x.x.dmg` |
| Windows | `Kammi-Setup-x.x.x.exe` |

### macOS Installation Note

Since Kammi is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will initially block it. Here's how to open it:

1. Download and open the `.dmg` file
2. Drag Kammi to your Applications folder
3. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on Kammi and select **"Open"**
4. Click **"Open"** in the dialog that appears

You only need to do this once — after that, Kammi opens normally.

### Windows Installation

Run the installer and follow the prompts. Windows may show a SmartScreen warning for unsigned apps — click "More info" → "Run anyway".

## Features

- **Zen-like focus** — Fullscreen, distraction-free writing
- **Beautiful themes** — Multiple carefully crafted color schemes
- **Session resume** — Continue exactly where you left off
- **Local-first** — Your writing stays on your machine
- **Lightweight** — Fast to open, gentle on resources

## Early Access

This is an early release. I'm sharing it with friends and my network to gather feedback.
